description: BetBazar is a Fullstack Webproject combining an Angular Frontend, a Java Spring Backend, with a MongoDB database and user-authentication through Google Firebase. It allows users to place bets which other users can accept.  Take a look at the project on my [Github](https://github.com/RingoDev/BetBazar).
